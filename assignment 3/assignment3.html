    <h1>Binary</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Binary system, which is a great invention invented by Leibniz, because of the invention of binary, human society has entered the information age, and calculators running in binary have solved most of our daily needs. In binary system we usually use two different symbols 1 and 0 to show information, this system is widely used in the computer area, modern computers and computer-dependent devices use binary, no matter what language we used to program, the underlying layers are stored in binary form, so no matter which programming language we learn, we still should understand the calculation of binary.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>The history of binary </h2>
    <h3>Leibniz</h3>
    <p>Leibniz is a German polymath active as a mathematician, philosopher, scientist, and diplomat, also he may have been the first computer scientist and information theorist.</p>
    <p>Leibniz's father a professor of ethics at the University of Leipzig, died when Leibniz was six-year-old, leaving a private library to him. At the age of 12, he taught himself Latin and began to learn Greek. He entered the University of Leipzig at the age of 14. He completed his studies at the age of 20, specializing in law and general university courses, In 1666 he published his first book on philosophy, “De Arte Combinatoria”. </p>
    <p>The modern binary number system was fully documented by Leibniz in the 17th century in his article Explication “de l'Arithmétique Binaire”, this system is a way to convert verbal logic statements into mathematical ones, for this system, he only uses zeros and ones.</p>
    <p>Leibniz wrote his system in an article called “Explanation of the Binary Arithmetic” in 1703 and shows how to use zeroes and ones to represent numbers. Leibniz expressed how simple the code is in the article. He wrote, “All these operations are so easy that there would never be any need to guess or try out anything.” Leibniz realized that binary could be used for automated calculation, but he didn't build this machine until 1937 George Stieglitz built a binary adder using relays.</p>
    <h3>Alan Turing</h3>
    <p>Alan Mathison Turing, an English mathematician and logician, is known as the father of computer science and artificial intelligence. His invention of the Turing machine was important for the widespread use of binary.</p>
    <p>The Second World War interrupted Alan's normal research work, and in the autumn of 1939 he was called up to the Foreign Office's Communications Office to do military work, mainly to break enemy codes. Because of the need to decipher, he participated in the development of the world's first electronic computer.</p>
    <p>When Alan finished his service at the Foreign Office in 1945, he tried to revive his pre-war research in theoretical computer science and combine it with his wartime work to develop new computers.</p>
    <p>Turing solves a most major problem, that is computer logic or language, because the computer can't think straight specific transaction or store specific affairs, Turing in binary, a machine can recognize, understand and storage of language, will reality concrete with pure digital abstract world together.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>The advantage of binary</h2>
    <h3>Easy to judge logically</h3>
    <p>Logic algebra is the theoretical basis of logic operations, binary only have two numerical code, which can coincide with the logic operation, for example, True or false, On or off, Yes or no, Enabled or disabled, and Initiated or uninitiated.</p>
    <h3>Easy to implement</h3>
    <p>When the computer working, voltage exists at each of the outputs, and the high and low voltage is converted into binary by analog-to-digital conversion, high voltage represents by 1, low voltage by 0, below 2.5 volts is considered a low-level, and above 3.2 volts is considered as high level. It means that we can convert an analog circuit into a digital circuit, and this is much easier to implement in the circuit.</p>
    <h3>Have anti-interference ability</h3>
    <p>For each data in binary, it has only high and low two states, when there is a certain amount of disturbance, it can still reliably tell if it's high or low, so we think to use binary to show data have a lot of advantages, for example, high reliability and strong anti-interference ability.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Calculation of binary</h2>
    <h3>Decimals to Binary</h3>
    <p>If we want to change decimals to binary, the only thing that we suppose to do is division. Let's look at the example and figure 1 below:</p>
    <p>We want to change 26 in decimals to binary, first, we divide it by 2, and if there is no reminder, we write 0 behind it, now we get 13, divide it by 2 again, and we can get 6 and reminder is 1, we write 1 behind it, repeat it until we get 1, after that, we can just rewrite it form the last reminder to first reminder, then, we get 11010 in binary. </p>

    <h3>Binary to Decimals</h3>
    <p>If we want to change binary to decimals, it is also pretty simple, the only thing that we should do is addition. Let's look at the example and figure 2 below:</p>
    <p>let's rewrite the number under it from the last digit, we write 2^0 for the last one, then 2^1 for the next, and repeat this step until the first number, now, we do a quick check, if the original number is 0, we ignore what we have under original number, if the original number is 1, we copy what we have under it, and add them together. Now, we have 2^4, 2^3, and 2^1 add them together we will get 26 in decimals.</p>

    <h2>How Binary actually work</h2>
    <h3>Compilation</h3>
    <p>When we write a program, we use the language that people can understand to programming it, but computer can't understand our language, so we are going to compilation it. For example, we write a simple program written in C programming language, which are named “Hi.c”, if we want computer under it and do what we want, it has to go through the following steps: Source file (hi.c) => Pre-processing (Hi.i) => Compilation (Hi.s) => Assemble (Hi.o) => Linker => Executable.</p>
    <p>First of all, we should pre-processing it, the file will change form source file “Hello.c” to “Hello.i”. The function of pre-processing is precompiled statements and file inclusion processing. That is, the macro instruction replacement and inclusion file is placed in the file to be compiled, and the complete C program source file will be generated after completion.</p>
    <p>Second, we are going to do compilation, the file will change form “Hello.i” to “Hello.s”. The function of compilation is compiled the file to generate “.s” suffix assembly language file, that is, the file is assembly language code, assembly is a low-level language, directly to the hard disk operation.</p>
    <p>Third, we will assemble the file, it going to change from “Hello.s” to “Hello.o”. The function of assemble is assemble the assembly language file, the main call assembly processing program to complete the assembly, assembly is the process of generating binary machine code, the file after the assembly ends with.o, called the object file.</p>
    <p>Last, we should do the linker, links the generated object file with a standard library and generates the final executable file. Its function is to module link multiple object files generated by assembly and reference library files, and generates a complete executable file. When linked, all object files are arranged in the appropriate locations in the executable program. At the same time, the library functions called by the program are also linked to the program from their respective function libraries.</p>
    <h3>ASCII</h3>
    <p>ASCII code is the most widely used character set and its encoding in computers, which are used to convert binary to words or some other characters. We know binary has two different states 1 and 0, but two bits of binary number can represent four states 00, 01, 10, 11. Keep doing this, we can image what will happen when we have seven bits of binary, we have 2^7 of states, which means that we have 128 states in total, those codes can be arranged as a decimal number from 0 to 127. ASCII code is a code that use seven bits of binary number to encode and represent 128 different characters.</p>
    <p>For example, the word “A” is represented by 1000001, we can easily find it in an image just on the top, so when we do programming, the computer can understand what we wanna do by translating the word to binary.</p>
    <p>we can also use this image to change binary to the octal numeral system or hexadecimal numeral system, or we can change the octal numeral system and hexadecimal numeral system to those 128 characters just the same as binary, even although octal and hexadecimal systems are not used by modern computers, they are still necessary because they are easier and less error-prone to human interaction than binary systems.</p>

    <h2>conclusion</h2>
    <p>This paper attempts to explore the development process of binary digitization and commemorate those who have made outstanding contributions to it. Thanks to the invention of binary and the wide application of computers, the development of today's society are changing with each passing day. We should be grateful to our ancestors, and work hard in the future.</p>
